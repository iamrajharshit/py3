# Write an Object oriented Python program to create two Time objects:
# currentTime, which contains the current time; and breadTime, which
# contains the amount of time it takes for a bread maker to make bread.
# Then we'll use addTime to figure out when the bread will be done.
# Write the printTime function to display the time when the bread will
# be done by the bread maker.
