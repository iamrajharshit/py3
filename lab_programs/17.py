# Develop python program to perform the below mentioned operations.

# a) display total marks scored by each student
# b) Display top scorer and the top score

# Scenario: There are 8 students and answers to 10 multiple
# choice questions of each student is stored in a file
# called marks.txt. Each answer is delimited by space. Each
# line provides a studentâ€™s answers to the questions, as
# shown below.The answer key isstored in a file named keys.txt.
# The format of answer keys as shown below.

# Key D B D C C D A E A D
# Student0 A B A C C D E E A D
# Student1 D B A B C A E E A D
# Student2 E D D A C B E E A D
# Student3 C B A E D C E E A D
# Student4 A B D C C D E E A D
# Student5 B B E C C D E E A D
# Student6 B B A C C D E E A D
# Student7 E B E C C D E E A D
